# Book-Recommendation-system-using-Machine-Learning
The objective of the project is to create a Book Recommendation system using various Machine Learning algorithms. A recommender system or a recommendation system is a subclass of information filtering system that seeks to predict the "rating" or "preference" a user would give to an item. A recommendation engine filters the data using different algorithms and recommends the most relevant items to users. It first captures the past behaviour of a customer and based on that, recommends products which the users might be likely to buy. The Recommendation system will recommend books to a user based on popularity, users’ previous ratings, ratings based on similar users. The dataset used is crossing’s Dataset (2004). It contains three tables, Books, Users and Ratings with missing values.
